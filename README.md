*   Your real name
*   The content of your messages

## 2. How Do We Use Your Information?

The information collected is used exclusively to provide the core functionality of the Bot. For example, your User ID is used to save your money so you don't lose it when you leave and rejoin a server.

All collected data is stored on a secure, private server (VPS). We take reasonable measures to protect your data from unauthorized access or disclosure.

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to outside parties. All data is for the sole use of the Bot's functionality.
